          A bouldering gym which is not only a gym, but also a workspace, café,
          event venue, and yoga studio. We were not looking to build a “better
          climbing gym”.
        </p>
        <p>Our goal is to connect people and create a community.</p>

          Climbing is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical challenge.
          We want our members to be able to enjoy quiet time within our
          facilities. To work between exercise and to exercise between work.
        </p>
        <p>
          We designed our facilities from the ground up, taking into account
          each element: every bolt, angle, surface, desk, pane of glass, and
          light. We understand that you want a facility that works as intended;
          no more afterthoughts.

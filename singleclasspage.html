        <h4>
          The Intermediate  course is targeted at recreational climbers, who
          want to progress from climbing Yellow (5c) / Blue (6b) boulders to
          higher grades while having fun and meeting new people!
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For 6 weeks you will learn about the different aspects of
            bouldering: balance, power, technique, route reading, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            There will be also an emphasis on “training and climbing together”
            as a team and socializing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The lessons are 1.5 hours each, giving you time to connect with
            fellow climbers and integrate what you’ve learned.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will train as a team with the same group and coach every class,
            improving your technique and meeting new climbing buddies!
          </li>
          <li>The minimum age for the course is 14 years old.</li>
          <li>Classes are held in English.</li>
